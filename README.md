My drive to go into technology is that I am interested in improving my critical thinking and problem solving skills. I believe that is one of the most 
valuable things about this degree, I have improved little by little each year, and I hope to continue to do so forever. Technology is constantly changing and automating and it's thrilling challenging myself to grow to understand what is new and what I haven't been exposed to.
