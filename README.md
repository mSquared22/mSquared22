Year:4th 
Major: Computer Science

I am interested in improving my critical thinking and problem solving skills. I believe that is one of the most 
valuable things about this degree, I have improved little by little each year, and I hope to continue to do so.
Currently, I am working a part time internship alongside my classes. And, I am working on a side project that
involves some statiscal and machine learning applications. My favorite hobbies are singing, running/lifting,
and hanging out with friends.
